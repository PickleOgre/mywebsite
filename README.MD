This is a heavily WIP site. Don't know exactly what I'll do with it yet. Probably just display a portfolio, CV, and some pictures.

## Structure

- **index.html**: Main page introducing myself and my passions.
- **portfolio.html**: Portfolio showcasing projects that combine technical skills with creative exploration.
- **resume.html**: Resume/CV area sharing my academic and professional experience.
- **blog.html**: Blog platform for publishing articles on chaos magick, historical mythology, and outdoorsmanship.
- **photos.html**: Photo gallery featuring images from my adventures.
